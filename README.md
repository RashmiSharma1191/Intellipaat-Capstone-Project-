Project Objective:
In the United States, numerous stores conducted surveys among students to gauge their spending habits across various 
categories such as Video Games, Indoor Games, Toys, Books, Gadgets, etc. The dataset, named "Student Survey," includes 
a column named "Store Setting," which indicates the type of location where the store is situated. This project aims to 
extract meaningful insights from the "Student Survey" dataset to provide valuable insights for retail stores operating 
in different settings.
